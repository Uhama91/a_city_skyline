# City Skyline

Welcome to the City Skyline project repository guided by FreeCodeCamp. This project was primarily an endeavor to delve deep into CSS variables and to further grasp various principles of the language.

## Overview

The City Skyline project is a visual representation of a skyline made purely using CSS. With the imaginative use of gradients, building-like shapes, and varying heights, we have attempted to capture the essence of a city's horizon during twilight. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Sky**: The sky's gradient background gives a realistic portrayal of dusk, transitioning from a sun-kissed gold to a serene shade of blue.
- **Foreground and Background Buildings**: There are two layers of buildings, providing a depth perception akin to a parallax effect.
- **Responsive Design**: The skyline adjusts gracefully to varying screen widths, making it compatible across devices.
- **Media Queries**: A darker theme is introduced for screens with widths of less than 1000px, further emphasizing the versatility of the design.
- **CSS Variables**: This project heavily leans on CSS variables to define and manage colors, making it exceptionally easy to tweak and customize.

## Code Structure

### HTML

The HTML structure consists of two primary divisions: 
- `.background-buildings`
- `.foreground-buildings`

Each division contains multiple divs representing buildings and their respective parts, such as windows.

### CSS

The CSS can be divided into several segments:
- **Variables**: Defining primary colors and variations used throughout the design.
- **Basic Styling**: Setting up the core appearance of the body, skyline, and overall layout.
- **Building Details**: Detailed styles for each building, window, and architectural feature.
- **Responsive Styling**: Media queries for screens with a maximum width of 1000px.

## Usage

To view the project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the HTML file in a browser of your choice.

## Acknowledgment

Gratitude to all the CSS pioneers and gurus whose work and insights contributed to the inspiration behind this project.
